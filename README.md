# Spelling-Bee

Welcome to the Spelling Bee repository! This project is a C++ program that utilizes a dictionary to search for a word containing 7 given letters. The program will ultimately return one of three outputs: PANGRAM, SB_WORD, or NOT_SBWORD.

# Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have a C++ compiler.

# Installation
To download and install this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone `https://github.com/Andyreww/Spelling-Bee.git`
2. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository
3. Run `make` to build the program

# Usage

To run the program, type `./spelling_bee` followed by the 7 letters you want to search for, like so:
```
./spelling_bee Metaphor
```
The program will then search for a word containing those 7 letters and return one of the following outputs:

- PANGRAM: The 7 letters form a pangram (a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once)
- SB_WORD: The 7 letters form a word that can be found in the dictionary
- NOT_SBWORD: The 7 letters do not form a word that can be found in the dictionary
